However as the storm system approached, a surface low pressure area formed along the frontal boundary, which helped to draw warm and humid conditions northward into the Coastal Bend. ||As the upper level storm system moved through the region, very strong wind shear developed and combined with an unstable atmosphere to produce a line of severe thunderstorms. A tornadic thunderstorm developed near the proximity of the surface low and retreating warm front, which persisted for over 20 miles travelling from just southeast of Alice to near Calallen. Damaging straight line winds affected most of the Coastal Bend and extended well into the Gulf of Mexico east of Rockport. Widespread wind damage was observed across the Coastal Bend as the storms moved quickly through the region. Approximately 30,000 customers lost power as a result of the storms. This marks the first time a tornado has been recorded in South Texas in the month of January, dating back to 1950. Property damage for the tornado and straight-line winds for the Coastal Bend was estimated to be around 10 million dollars.  ||From Calallen through Portland and Rockport, doppler radar indicated a broad, yet strong rotation between 4 and 430 AM CST. A NWS storm survey concluded straight-line winds between 70 and 90 mph occurred along this path. A path length of damage of nearly 65 miles was observed from the starting point of the tornado in Jim Wells County to the end of the straight-line wind damage in Rockport. ||Further north, doppler radar indicated another bowing segment in the line across  Victoria and Calhoun Counties between 400 and 500 AM CST.

This activity produced large hail as it affected portions of Lubbock and Crosby Counties. Additional high based thunderstorm activity developed in drier air to the west of the Interstate 27 corridor. This convection caused significant wind damage in Anton (Hockley County) before it evolved into a complex that produced damaging winds and large hail over a large swath of the central South Plains, generally north of Lubbock. Meanwhile, two large high-precipitation supercell storms developed over the four-county area of Crosby, Dickens, Kent, and Garza Counties.

As a strong upper level low pressure system over northern Mexico approached the region providing strong shear in the atmosphere, an outbreak of supercell thunderstorms occurred across South Texas producing an unprecedented 16 tornadoes. The number of tornadoes is a record for a single day for a non-tropical event in South Texas. All of the tornadoes were weak with the strongest tornado collapsing a grain elevator west of Taft and damaging several homes in a subdivision north of Taft in the evening.||Severe storms started early in the morning in the western Brush Country. Several long track supercell storms moved across the Brush Country and portions of the Coastal Bend during the day. Most of the tornadoes occurred with these storms in the afternoon and early evening. The storms evolved into a large squall line that moved across the Coastal Plains during the evening hours. The squall line produced winds of 70 to 90 mph causing extensive tree damage and localized property damage. The episode of severe weather ended over the Gulf of Mexico after midnight. Damage estimates from the severe weather episode were in the millions of dollars for South Texas.||Several storms moved across the same area for hours during the event.

A tractor trailer that was traveling on US Highway 287 was hit by this downburst and was blown over. No Injuries were relayed with this report from the Armstrong County Emergency Manager.,"A severe weather outbreak brought hail, damaging winds, tornadoes, and flash flooding to the Panhandles from the afternoon of the 28th into the early morning hours of the 29th. The morning upper air analysis on the 28th showed a mid-level shortwave trough rotating around the base of a longwave trough situated from Idaho to Arizona. At the surface, a dryline was situated from the northeastern Oklahoma Panhandle to the southwestern Texas Panhandle. The 6 AM CST upper air sounding from Amarillo showed a low level capping inversion with significant elevated instability. Also deep layer shear was primed for the development of discrete supercells. On the 12 PM CST sounding, instability values had increased further. By noon, the northern portion of the dryline had moved into south central Kansas before stretching back into the southwestern Texas Panhandle. ||By the late afternoon, across Potter and Randall Counties, the dryline had advanced into the western portions of both counties allowing showers and thunderstorms, which moved northeastward along dryline, to produce damaging wind gusts in the Amarillo (Potter and Randall County) area. These thunderstorm wind gusts blew a communication tower and billboard down at the Texas Blue Lake Pools in Amarillo (Randall County). Also a main communication tower for High Plains Radio was damaged which ended the broadcast for several of their across the Texas Panhandle radio stations. The Amarillo Police Department blocked off an area near the intersection of Osage Road and SE 27th Ave due to downed power lines and debris.  As the dryline moved into the eastern portions of Potter and Randall Counties during the early evening, thunderstorms over the Amarillo area were cut off from moist inflows and decayed quickly. The extremely dry near surface air evaporated precipitation from the decaying storms causing non-thunderstorm high winds across the Amarillo area. These high winds blew the roof off the River Road ISD field house (Randall County) and downed power lines across the city. Xcel Energy reported nearly 6500 people lost power from the combination of thunderstorm and non-thunderstorm wind gusts, and 4000 people would remain without power until the 29th as power lines and poles were repaired or replaced.   ||During the late evening the dryline began to retreat westward as the nocturnal low level jet transported moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northwestward. As the dryline retreated across Oldham and Deaf Smith Counties, a near stationary discrete supercell formed and produced two short lived tornadoes in Deaf Smith County. These tornadoes formed over grasslands, and produced little damage. As the dryline continued to retreat to the west, the supercell took a northeastward track producing hail up to the size of hen eggs across Deaf Smith and Oldham Counties and produced several funnel clouds. ||The storm continued to produce large hail and funnel clouds as it moved into Potter and Randall Counties. This large hail broke out skylights, broke windshields, busted out windows of portables, and damaged work vehicles at schools within the Bushland (Randall County) ISD. As the supercell approached the western portion of Amarillo (Randall and Potter County) several members of the public reported funnel clouds. Video evidence of one such funnel cloud showed the cloud lowering near to the ground, but no physical evidence of a touchdown was able to be identified by National Weather Service survey teams. ||What this supercell did produce across Amarillo (Potter and Randall County) was copious amounts of destructive hail up to the size of baseballs and heavy rain. The City of Amarillo reported that 225 of its work vehicles had some form of hail damage with an estimated repair cost between $2000 and $8500. The City Building Safety Director reported approximately 75 percent of homes around the city suffered hail damage of varying degrees. The Amarillo Botanical Gardens suffered massive damage to plants across the four acre property totaling in thousands of dollars of damage. The hail also damaged a greenhouse in the rear portion of the property. The accumulation of hail and heavy rain also flooded the Garden_è__è__è_s gallery while the strong winds blew a portion of the perimeter fencing down. Gene Messer Ford and AutoNation Chevrolet-Cadillac reported between 300 and 400 vehicles damaged from the hail with Gene Messer Ford estimating the damage to be between 3 and 4 million dollars. The total estimated of repair cost across the city of Amarillo (Randall and Potter Counties) is near $400 million dollars which dwarfs the June 21, 2004 hail storm which cost the city $175 million dollars. ||The supercell continued traveling to the northeast entering into Carson County. Upon entering the county the supercell encountered an increasing unfavorable environment as the nocturnal inversion strengthened. However, before the dissipating the thunderstorm was able to produce quarter size hail in the city of Panhandle (Carson County). The remnants of the supercell proceeded to move to the northeast until dissipating over southern Kansas.",270,,

Several vehicles in Paducah had windows blown out by airborne gravel and other small debris. Fortunately, no injuries were reported as residents received ample warning to seek shelter.","Very strong instability and ample wind shear created a volatile airmass in the eastern Panhandle and Rolling Plains on the afternoon and evening of the 30th. A weak surface low moved into the northeast South Plains early in the afternoon and enhanced lift along a sharp dryline and residual outflow boundary. By mid-afternoon, a pair of thunderstorms erupted in Hall and Motley Counties and quickly became supercells while moving to the east and southeast. These storms produced very large and even giant hail at times and were accompanied by intense inflow and outflow wind gusts at or above 60 mph.||The second of these supercells produced several gustnadoes and at least four weak, non-mesocyclonic tornadoes under its flanking line as it moved through central Cottle County. However, all of the damage in and around the Paducah area was attributed to ferocious winds in the rear flank downdraft (RFD) of this supercell. Although NWS radars from both Lubbock, TX and Frederick, OK indicated a high probability of a significant tornado in far eastern Cottle County from this same storm, a NWS storm survey found no such evidence despite a large tornado having occurred a short while later in nearby western Foard County.||By early evening, a third supercell developed northwest of Paducah and tracked south-southeast into King County. This storm produced a weak tornado about nine miles west of Paducah that moved over open land before crossing Highway 70 and dissipating. While in King County, this supercell produced scattered to widespread structural and tree damage in Guthrie from intense RFD winds estimated to be at least 80 mph.",269,,

The community of Cone was struck especially hard by these winds. An older, single family home had a west-facing wall partially collapse, and the roof to a grain store was blown off and deposited on US Highway 62 forcing a temporary closure of the road. Additional damage in Cone consisted of several downed power lines, about ten snapped utility poles, a few downed trees, light to moderate building damage, and one metal shed that was destroyed and had its contents of antique tractors and vehicles damaged. The NWS damage survey also noted several dozen more damaged power lines throughout northern Crosby County, along with multiple center pivot irrigation systems overturned. Cotton, corn, and sorghum crops sustained light to moderate damage, however some crops used as silage were completely flattened by the intense winds.

The Lakewood area of Dallas was one of the hardest hit areas. Part of the Lakewood Theater was damaged, and thousands of divots damaged the golf course at the Lakewood Country Club. Historic homes on Swiss Avenue sustained significant roof damage with roof repairs on a few homes estimated over $100,000. A glass exhibit at the Dallas Arboretum sustained damage that was described as relatively minor. This supercell continued to track into Ellis County producing hail damage down to Midlothian. The second supercell in Dallas County tracked from Irving into Cedar Hill. Another supercell produced an EF-0 tornado, 70-95 mph downburst winds, and softball sized hail in Fannin County. The fourth supercell produced hail up to 3.25 in diameter in Collin County. Damage estimates were estimated as high as $2 billion dollars for this event, but insurance companies anticipated the final damage totals to be around $1.1 billion.

The State Farm Arena lost a large part of its cladding (side wall) and up to 40% of its roof shingles and underneath decking allowing rainwater to leak into the facility. A several thousand foot community center in the town of Granejo was destroyed as free-standing reinforced cinderblock walls crumbled, and the wind destroyed ductwork/HVAC and an entire side wall on its way out of the building. A tractor trailer weighing 79,000 pounds, including freight, was moved and then tipped on its side in the community of Madero. Hundreds of softwood trees were uprooted and thousands of tree limbs were snapped, these included ash, mesquite, ebony, and palm. Dozens of wooden power poles were snapped, with more than 20,000 customers without power.","A mini-supercell and associated downburst core moved across south central Hidalgo County beginning in the Palmview/Mission area and generally tracked along and just north of the Rio Grande before crossing the river southeast of Pharr.  A NWS survey, combined with radar assessment, determined a path length of 19.4 miles and a path width, which varied, of 1 to 3 miles. Peak winds were estimated to be 85 to 95 mph, though 100 mph or greater winds may have occurred on elevated surfaces, particularly at the State Farm Arena in the city of Hidalgo. Peak winds pulsed at two phases of the storm, and likely lasted 5 or more minutes. Initial damage to tree limbs and some poorly built roofs in the Mission/Palmview area would intensify by the time the downburst reached the Madero and Granjeno communities, where more than 100 homes sustained varying levels of damage, dozens of power poles were felled, and hundreds of softwood trees were uprooted. In addition to the wind, one to two inch diameter hail fell, some of it driven by the strong winds.",24,,

The blown down fences allowed between 50 and 60 head of cattle to become loose and block a roadway.,"Moist upslope flow along a retreating east-west oriented surface boundary focused scattered thunderstorms early this evening across the western South Plains. Ample wind shear and instability allowed several of these storms to quickly become supercellular producing very large hail, some giant, accompanied by destructive straight-line winds as they drifted east-southeast. The most prolific supercell developed west-northwest of Levelland around 1800 CST and moved eastward near Highway 114 before merging with another supercell near the Hockley-Lubbock County line. At this point, the supercell intensified further and turned southeast moving across southwest and south-central Lubbock County as a significant high precipitation supercell. Destructive winds and very large hail (up to softball size in a few locations) accompanied this storm as it tracked from near Smyer southeast to Woodrow creating extensive damage to structures and vehicles in its path. A NWS storm survey revealed the most significant damage occurred from wind-driven hail along FM 41 just west of Highway 87 and also between FM 179 and Woodrow Road. In some instances, the west-facing exterior of homes in these areas was completely shredded. This damage was compounded by the supercell's slow motion which resulted in up to a 15-minute period of destructive wind gusts as high as 95 mph as measured by a West Texas Mesonet site located 6SSW Wolfforth.||Later this evening, the low-level jet intensified and ignited additional severe storms over portions of the central and southern South Plains. One of these storms was a slow-moving elevated supercell that moved over areas of southeast Hockley and southwest Lubbock Counties previously impacted by the earlier supercell. This storm created additional instances of large hail; however, excessive rainfall in a short time span over already wet soils lead to large areas of mostly rural flooding. Many roads especially between Levelland and Wolfforth became impassable due to swollen playa lakes.

An NWS damage survey team determined the most intense winds were focused about 2.5 miles east of downtown Levelland.  It was in this area that a pole barn's metal support beams were ripped from their anchors and a car along State Highway 114 was blown off the road and flipped over.  The driver of the car was shaken, but not injured.  Damage elsewhere was consistent with winds of 70 to 90 mph and was comprised of peeled back roofs on some buildings and mobile homes, some street signs bent flat to the ground, many large trees snapped at their base, and even a trampoline wrapped around a power pole.  Three industrial buildings sustained substantial damage. Sections of streets were so cluttered with structural debris that front-end loaders were required to clear a safe path for travel.

As this squall line decayed after sunset, additional storms fired along its outflow from the southeast Texas Panhandle through the Rolling Plains. One of these storms east of Childress produced a dust storm that contributed to a fatal multi-vehicle accident near Kirkland.  After midnight, a small line of showers and some thunderstorms redeveloped over the western South Plains and moved south.

Power outages were common as several dozen power poles were snapped. Fortunately, no injuries occurred during this extended bout of destructive winds; however, damage to some homes was compounded by heavy rains entering damaged roofs and cracked windows resulting in water damage to carpets, walls and furniture.

These storms produced very large and even giant hail at times and were accompanied by intense inflow and outflow wind gusts at or above 60 mph.||The second of these supercells produced several gustnadoes and at least four weak, non-mesocyclonic tornadoes under its flanking line as it moved through central Cottle County. However, all of the damage in and around the Paducah area was attributed to ferocious winds in the rear flank downdraft (RFD) of this supercell. Although NWS radars from both Lubbock, TX and Frederick, OK indicated a high probability of a significant tornado in far eastern Cottle County from this same storm, a NWS storm survey found no such evidence despite a large tornado having occurred a short while later in nearby western Foard County.||By early evening, a third supercell developed northwest of Paducah and tracked south-southeast into King County.

Ahead of the band, however, an isolated tornadic supercell moved from Lynn County northeast across Crosby and Dickens Counties.  One of its tornadoes struck a lone, double-wide mobile home about one-half mile west of White River Lake (or about 6 miles NNE of Kalgary) in Crosby County, killing one 78 year-old male and injuring a 73 year-old female.  The couple was preparing to leave for shelter just as the tornado struck.  It totally demolished the structure and damaged a vehicle.  This same cell had caused tornadoes in southern and eastern Lynn County earlier (as reported by chasers and spotters), and proceeded to cause other tornadoes in Dickens and eastern Crosby Counties (as reported by spotters and local law enforcement).  Near Afton (Dickens Co.), a trailer was damaged, the roof of a cotton gin was ripped off, and a chimney collapsed due to a tornado.At almost the same time as the White River Lake tornado, severe winds caused damage to the Liberty Acres community just northeast of Lubbock International Airport.  Several houses were damaged (one severely) and several mobile homes were damaged (one severely), too.  The winds also knocked down four utility poles and a few trees (one of which damaged a car).  Although some people believed this storm was a tornado, a damage survey by researchers from Texas Tech's wind engineering group, as well as one by NWS officials, proved inconclusive.Minutes before the storm damaged Liberty Acres, it dropped golfball-size hail over  west parts of the City of Lubbock, damaging 3,000 to 4,000 homes as well as a few thousand vehicles.  Damages from the hail were estimated at more than $30 million.A tornado west of Plainview uprooted trees and damaged two barns.Note:  The tornado description below was added in 2005 after the report was relayed to the NWS as a result of other requests.

Ample wind shear and instability allowed several of these storms to quickly become supercellular producing very large hail, some giant, accompanied by destructive straight-line winds as they drifted east-southeast. The most prolific supercell developed west-northwest of Levelland around 1800 CST and moved eastward near Highway 114 before merging with another supercell near the Hockley-Lubbock County line. At this point, the supercell intensified further and turned southeast moving across southwest and south-central Lubbock County as a significant high precipitation supercell. Destructive winds and very large hail (up to softball size in a few locations) accompanied this storm as it tracked from near Smyer southeast to Woodrow creating extensive damage to structures and vehicles in its path. A NWS storm survey revealed the most significant damage occurred from wind-driven hail along FM 41 just west of Highway 87 and also between FM 179 and Woodrow Road. In some instances, the west-facing exterior of homes in these areas was completely shredded. This damage was compounded by the supercell's slow motion which resulted in up to a 15-minute period of destructive wind gusts as high as 95 mph as measured by a West Texas Mesonet site located 6SSW Wolfforth.||Later this evening, the low-level jet intensified and ignited additional severe storms over portions of the central and southern South Plains. One of these storms was a slow-moving elevated supercell that moved over areas of southeast Hockley and southwest Lubbock Counties previously impacted by the earlier supercell. This storm created additional instances of large hail; however, excessive rainfall in a short time span over already wet soils lead to large areas of mostly rural flooding. Many roads especially between Levelland and Wolfforth became impassable due to swollen playa lakes.

This combined with the lack of similar damage in the vicinity suggests that straight-line winds were likely no more than 80 mph.,"A small cluster of strong and slow-moving thunderstorms developed late this afternoon in and around the Muleshoe area and dropped hail up to penny size. By early evening, outflow from these collapsing storms gave rise to a particularly tall and intense storm in northwest Hale County. As this storm collapsed, an outrush of damaging winds spread south and east across much of Hale, southern Floyd and northeast Lubbock counties stirring up loose dirt from area fields.

The downburst caused moderate damage to a greenhouse located at Lowe's Home Improvement store. At a nearby Home Depot store, the canopy to a greenhouse was partially damaged and several steel fence posts embedded in concrete were bent. At an apartment complex located near 50th Street and Slide Road, the roof of one unit was blown off. Damage to homes was generally light and consisted of some downed fences, broken rain gutters and torn roofing shingles. Many trees lost limbs of various sizes and in a few cases entire trees were toppled. Power outages were confined mostly to small grids in and around the path of the downburst.

Although NWS radar indicated the likelihood of severe hail and damaging winds, no ground truth was available throughout the life of this storm. By late evening, lingering outflow boundaries collided in southwest Lubbock County and gave rise to intense multicell storms; one of which produced a destructive downburst that traveled from just northwest of the Lubbock South Plains Mall northeast to the Lubbock Airport and into rural northeast Lubbock County. A swath of straight-line winds estimated as high as 70 mph at times caused light to moderate structural damage at two large home improvement stores and removed the roof from an apartment building.

These thunderstorms would take a northeast track which allowed them to move over the dryline. This caused the thunderstorms to produce isolated downbursts across the city. While a thunderstorm was over the intersection of 6th Ave and Osage Road a roof was blown off a metal building due to a downburst. The Amarillo (Potter and Randall County) Emergency Manager reported this damage. The thunderstorm decayed quickly after moving to the dry side of the dryline due to ingesting much drier air into the updrafts.  No injuries were associated with this gust.,"A severe weather outbreak brought hail, damaging winds, tornadoes, and flash flooding to the Panhandles from the afternoon of the 28th into the early morning hours of the 29th. The morning upper air analysis on the 28th showed a mid-level shortwave trough rotating around the base of a longwave trough situated from Idaho to Arizona. At the surface, a dryline was situated from the northeastern Oklahoma Panhandle to the southwestern Texas Panhandle. The 6 AM CST upper air sounding from Amarillo showed a low level capping inversion with significant elevated instability. Also deep layer shear was primed for the development of discrete supercells. On the 12 PM CST sounding, instability values had increased further. By noon, the northern portion of the dryline had moved into south central Kansas before stretching back into the southwestern Texas Panhandle. ||By the late afternoon, across Potter and Randall Counties, the dryline had advanced into the western portions of both counties allowing showers and thunderstorms, which moved northeastward along dryline, to produce damaging wind gusts in the Amarillo (Potter and Randall County) area. These thunderstorm wind gusts blew a communication tower and billboard down at the Texas Blue Lake Pools in Amarillo (Randall County). Also a main communication tower for High Plains Radio was damaged which ended the broadcast for several of their across the Texas Panhandle radio stations. The Amarillo Police Department blocked off an area near the intersection of Osage Road and SE 27th Ave due to downed power lines and debris.  As the dryline moved into the eastern portions of Potter and Randall Counties during the early evening, thunderstorms over the Amarillo area were cut off from moist inflows and decayed quickly. The extremely dry near surface air evaporated precipitation from the decaying storms causing non-thunderstorm high winds across the Amarillo area. These high winds blew the roof off the River Road ISD field house (Randall County) and downed power lines across the city. Xcel Energy reported nearly 6500 people lost power from the combination of thunderstorm and non-thunderstorm wind gusts, and 4000 people would remain without power until the 29th as power lines and poles were repaired or replaced.   ||During the late evening the dryline began to retreat westward as the nocturnal low level jet transported moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northwestward. As the dryline retreated across Oldham and Deaf Smith Counties, a near stationary discrete supercell formed and produced two short lived tornadoes in Deaf Smith County. These tornadoes formed over grasslands, and produced little damage. As the dryline continued to retreat to the west, the supercell took a northeastward track producing hail up to the size of hen eggs across Deaf Smith and Oldham Counties and produced several funnel clouds. ||The storm continued to produce large hail and funnel clouds as it moved into Potter and Randall Counties. This large hail broke out skylights, broke windshields, busted out windows of portables, and damaged work vehicles at schools within the Bushland (Randall County) ISD. As the supercell approached the western portion of Amarillo (Randall and Potter County) several members of the public reported funnel clouds. Video evidence of one such funnel cloud showed the cloud lowering near to the ground, but no physical evidence of a touchdown was able to be identified by National Weather Service survey teams. ||What this supercell did produce across Amarillo (Potter and Randall County) was copious amounts of destructive hail up to the size of baseballs and heavy rain. The City of Amarillo reported that 225 of its work vehicles had some form of hail damage with an estimated repair cost between $2000 and $8500. The City Building Safety Director reported approximately 75 percent of homes around the city suffered hail damage of varying degrees. The Amarillo Botanical Gardens suffered massive damage to plants across the four acre property totaling in thousands of dollars of damage. The hail also damaged a greenhouse in the rear portion of the property. The accumulation of hail and heavy rain also flooded the Garden_è__è__è_s gallery while the strong winds blew a portion of the perimeter fencing down. Gene Messer Ford and AutoNation Chevrolet-Cadillac reported between 300 and 400 vehicles damaged from the hail with Gene Messer Ford estimating the damage to be between 3 and 4 million dollars. The total estimated of repair cost across the city of Amarillo (Randall and Potter Counties) is near $400 million dollars which dwarfs the June 21, 2004 hail storm which cost the city $175 million dollars. ||The supercell continued traveling to the northeast entering into Carson County. Upon entering the county the supercell encountered an increasing unfavorable environment as the nocturnal inversion strengthened.

After sunrise, these storms progressed eastward into Southeast Oklahoma, Southwest Arkansas, Northeast Texas and Northwest Louisiana.  While the atmosphere was pretty stable at the surface...moderate instability existed aloft which resulted in rather steep mid level temperature lapse rates.  This was conducive for the development of large hail which was widespread across the region...ranging from pea size to up to golfball size.

Here, significant damage was incurred to many units at the Highway 496 Storage facility. ||The microburst slammed into the west facing wall of the first of two long, cinderblock structures, and lifted most of the roof up and over the first building, slamming it into the second building about 50 feet to the east. While the truss and bracing of the roof appeared sound, only long nails were found at the connections of the eaves. Missiles generated by the broken roof drove into both cinderblock, and an individual metal garage, in the second building. Another light metal structure, housing another set of individual storage units, separated and collapsed on the leeward side of the second building. ||The microburst continued moving steadily southeast, causing notable damage to neighborhoods in the southwest part of town. Dozens of homes and other structures with poorly anchored roofing material sustained significant damage; a large portion of tin roof was removed from a two story church a few blocks from the center of town. Another barrel-tile roof was damaged at a motel, and the water leak caused at least one unit to be uninhabitable.||In all neighborhoods, hundreds of mesquite and ebony tree limbs of many shapes and sizes were snapped off, some onto roofs, including the town's public library.  As the storm finally edged south, additional tree damage was noted in the Falcon Lake Estates subdivision, just south of the bridge, where a report of a blown down roof of a two story house was also received as the storm weakened slightly.||The Zapata County Emergency Manager reported power lines and several trees were down in Zapata and approximately 200 to 300 people were without power at 9 pm. ||Wind speeds were estimated to be between 70 and 75 mph area wide, with the strongest speeds generally along and just south of FM 496 from just west of the cemetary to highway 83.  Total path length was estimated to be a little more than 3.5 miles long; width was estimated to be about 1.5 miles.","The combined effects of a developing subtropical jet stream, a weak  upper level disturbance propagating northeastward from Mexico, a weak surface boundary moving south into Deep South Texas, and a very unstable atmospheric profile across the western Lower Rio Grande Valley and Rio Grande Plains, produced strong to severe thunderstorms over northern Mexico and the western and central counties of the Lower Rio Grande Valley during the late evening of May 14th.",141,,
